**About Dataset**: <br></br>

**Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting:** <br></br>

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus "chained" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred.
As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow.<br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do we actually understand by Time Series Forecasting**...<br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Time Series Forecasting?** <br></br>

Time series forecasting is a technique that uses historical data to predict future values over a period of time. It's a type of predictive analytics that involves building models based on historical data to make observations and guide future decisions <br></br>
